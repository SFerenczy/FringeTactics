# Iteration: 2025-12 – Crew Loop 01

## Experience Goal

- Player can inspect each crew member and immediately understand:
  - Who they are (name/role, key stats, traits, injuries).
  - Why they matter (how they contribute to missions).
- Firing / replacing crew is a meaningful decision, not a blind click.
- Encounters and missions leave visible marks on the roster (injuries, deaths, new hires).

## Slices in Scope

| Slice | Domain | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **MG-UI1** | Management | Crew roster & detail screen |
| **MG-UI2** | Management | Fire / dismiss crew |
| **EN-SYS1** | Encounter | Encounter injuries → Management injuries |
| **EN-CONTENT1** | Encounter | Injury-focused encounter pack (small) |

Each slice is defined in the relevant `DOMAINS/*/ROADMAP.md` and, if needed, `*_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

## Implementation Order

1. **MG-UI1** – Crew roster & detail (visibility first)
2. **EN-SYS1** – Encounter injuries → Management (wire the effect)
3. **EN-CONTENT1** – Injury-focused encounters (content to exercise the wire)
4. **MG-UI2** – Fire / dismiss crew (meaningful once you know who you're firing)
